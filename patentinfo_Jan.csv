155,HEAT EXCHANGER FOR ELECTRIC FOOD DRIERS,"FIELD: power engineering.SUBSTANCE: invention relates to energy saving, namely to devices for heat energy recovery in drying installations, and can be used, mainly, in household electric desiccants for vegetables, berries, fruits and other products with a sharp reduction in electricity consumption. All known household electric food driers during operation are discharged with moist air into the surrounding space and all heat received from the electric heater. Heat exchanger is a nozzle consisting of concentrically arranged shells of different thermal conductivity materials, forming channels for incoming and outgoing air flows with their optimal heat exchange, inner shell is made with a varying height. This design of the claimed heat exchanger makes it easy to install and remove it without any connecting operations and devices for connection to dryers, and the inner shell with a variable height allows it to be used for a different number of sections (pallets) installed in the dryer and even with different models of dryers (with the same diameter). Counter motion along the surfaces of the middle shell of the two streams creates optimal heat exchange regime, providing the necessary maximum possible heat recovery. At the same time, energy costs are reduced several times, that in the general scale of mass use of electric dryers will provide energy saving in the domestic sector in significant amounts.EFFECT: proposed heat exchanger reduces power consumption several times while maintaining the quality and duration of drying of products; it does not require any assembly with dryers, is compact and convenient to use.1 cl, 1 dwg",RU2642954C1 2018-01-29,F28D9/00F28D21/00,1
