All known household electric food driers during operation are discharged with moist air into the surrounding space and all heat received from the electric heater. Heat exchanger is a nozzle consisting of concentrically arranged shells of different thermal conductivity materials, forming channels for incoming and outgoing air flows with their optimal heat exchange, inner shell is made with a varying height. This design of the claimed heat exchanger makes it easy to install and remove it without any connecting operations and devices for connection to dryers, and the inner shell with a variable height allows it to be used for a different number of sections (pallets) installed in the dryer and even with different models of dryers (with the same diameter). Counter motion along the surfaces of the middle shell of the two streams creates optimal heat exchange regime, providing the necessary maximum possible heat recovery. At the same time, energy costs are reduced several times, that in the general scale of mass use of electric dryers will provide energy saving in the domestic sector in significant amounts.EFFECT: proposed heat exchanger reduces power consumption several times while maintaining the quality and duration of drying of products; it does not require any assembly with dryers, is compact and convenient to use.1 cl, 1 dwg","RU2642954C1 2018-01-29","YASAKOV NIKOLAJ VASILEVICH",22/08/2016,"RU2642954C1 2016-08-22","YASAKOV NIKOLAJ VASILEVICH","F28D9/00F28D21/00",,"RU2642954C1",,1,

The improvement to the evaporating water distribution is by water pipes(6) with holes(8) inside wet channel(A-A). This solution guarantees that all of the evaporative layers will get adequate wetting, and the evaporation will be not limited by the water buildup. By an unique water distribution structure in the wet channels(A-A), uniform water film is created on the surfaces of evaporative media. This enlarges the wetting area of wet channels(A-A) with minimum water flow and allows the performance of the heat and mass transfer to be increased. The proposed water distribution system consumes very little energy for its operation, only a small pump, due to the lack of water nozzles which require high water pressure for operation. The energy efficiency of the system will therefore be extremely high.","WO2018051157A1 2018-03-22","AURAE TECH LIMITED",19/09/2016,"WO2018051157A1 2016-09-19","PANDELIDIS DEMS LUKASZ","F24F5/00F25D17/06",,"WO2018051157A1",,1,
